        "This assignment is in two parts.  The first is a set of exercises and the second is a reflection / essay style series of questions consolidating learning and encouraging a deeper understanding of APIs.\n",
        "\n",
        "The exercises in this project reinforce basic API usage concepts using the \"Rick and Morty\" API. Each exercise builds upon the previous ones and introduces new concepts.\n",

        "# Background\n",
        "\n",
        "[The \"Rick and Morty\" API](https://rickandmortyapi.com) is a RESTful web service that provides information about the characters, locations, and episodes from the [\"Rick and Morty\"](https://www.adultswim.com/videos/rick-and-morty) animated television series. It's designed to allow developers to query and retrieve data programmatically, which makes it an excellent tool for educational purposes, fan projects, or applications that require information from the show's universe.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an overview of the main features of the API:\n",
        "\n",
        "- [**Characters:**](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#character) You can retrieve data about characters, including their names, species, images, location, and status (alive, dead, or unknown). This allows developers to use character data for creating applications or services that need detailed information about the show's cast.\n",
        "\n",
        "- [**Locations:**](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#location) The API provides details about the various locations that characters in the show have visited, including planets, dimensions, and more. This can be used to create applications that provide a geographical context for the events in the series.\n",
        "\n",
        "- [**Episodes:**](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#episode) Information about each episode is available through the API, including air dates, the episode's name, and the characters that appear in it. This is useful for creating applications that track story arcs or character appearances.\n",
        "\n",
        "- [**Filters and Queries:**](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#filter-characters) The API supports filtering and search queries, which means developers can request lists of characters, locations, or episodes based on specific criteria (like all characters who are \"Human\" or locations in a particular dimension).\n",
        "\n",
        "- [**Pagination:**](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#info-and-pagination) To manage large datasets, the API uses pagination, so developers need to write code that can handle multiple requests if they want to retrieve all items in a category.\n",
        "\n",
        "[The \"Rick and Morty\" API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation) is a fun and engaging way for fans and developers to interact with the show's rich and detailed universe. Its straightforward design and comprehensive dataset make it an excellent choice for teaching API interaction concepts.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Exercises\n",
        "\n",
        "The following exercises offer practice using an API. References are provided below.  However,\n",
        "in this scaffold I'm NOT providing much sample code.  See the references below for sample code.\n",
        "\n",
        "TIP: I suggest that you start with the [python API tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-api-tutorial) in the references. You'll probably want to use the *requests* module. If you get a *module not found* error when you import it, then you'll need to make sure that Poetry adds it to your environment using *poetry add requests*.\n"
